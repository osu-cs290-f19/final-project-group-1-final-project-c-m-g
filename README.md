Things to consider:
HTML:
  --how to format the "Create Recipe Card" modal to allow for different amounts of ingredients
      --could have an "add ingredient" button within to add another line item
  --each row for ingredient could include these fields "input volume" (account for fractions in formatting), choose "unit of measure" dropdown, and then a regular text input for the "ingredient name"
  
   -- and create the corresponding data sets within the DOM I have already created.
