Things to consider:
HTML:
  --how to format the "Create Recipe Card" modal to allow for different amounts of ingredients
      --could have an "add ingredient" button within to add another line item
  --each row for ingredient could include these fields "input volume" (account for fractions in formatting), choose "unit of measure" dropdown, and then a regular text input for the "ingredient name"
  
   -- and create the corresponding data sets within the DOM I have already created.

JS
  -Finalize list of functions we need to add to the JS file for our HTML to work
  -Translate the necessary functions to Handlebars, partials and templates to dynamically create content.
  -Integrate MongoDB into this process as well, will get better idea.
  
Need to Make/Do:
  -server.js to include our server with appropriate usage of npm, express, handlebars, and express-handlebars
  -package.json with appropriate template generation and partials in associated .handlebars files
